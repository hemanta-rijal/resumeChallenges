Hello everyone, 
Just completed the Resume Challenge Project by Codebasics,

ðŸŒŸ PROBLEM ðŸŒŸ
Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market.

ðŸŒŸ TASK ðŸŒŸ

ðŸŒŸ KEY FINDINGðŸŒŸ
- IT employees have the highest shares of income utilization. 
- Majority of spending falls within the range of Rs. 0-500. 
- Income Utilization % is increasing in the summer season. 
- Bills Payment is more likely to be used by credit card. 

ðŸŒŸ CREDIT CARD RECOMMANDATIONðŸŒŸ
- There is a significant gap in the age group of 25-34 and 35-45 in terms of using credit cards while there is minimal difference in terms of total spending, so the age group of 35-45 would be the potential target audience.
- Grocessories is in the 2nd most spent category while the majority of transactions are held through UPI and it is in 4th place in terms of credit card use. Campaigns should be focused on processors to improve credit card performance. 

I'd like to thank Mr. Hemanand Vadivel and Mr. Dhaval Patel for providing the wonderful opportunities to be part of this Challenge.
